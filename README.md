# About this repository

This repository hosts a GitHub Pages website. The website is an example of a blog made in Jekyll, with dated posts and automated page creation.

It also uses the basic tools needed for website creation, such as HTML and CSS.

## What does this show?

This website demonstrates skills needed for basic website creation, along with showing experience with a static site generator - in this case, Jekyll.

# Web Pages

## Home and About Pages
These pages contain a title and paragraph made using Jekyll. They use a default theme that contains a header with three links to different pages, and a footer with links to the repository and website.

## Blogs
The blog index page shows a list of blog entries. Using Jekyll, this list is automatically updated every time a new blog entry is added or removed. There is one example blog page in the `/blogs/` folder, with a title, content and date. In `_config.yml` the blog pages are set to generate in the same folder as the index.
